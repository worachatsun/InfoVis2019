  "description": "First scan. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center performed 82 abdominal contrast enhanced 3D CT scans (~70 seconds after intravenous contrast injection in portal-venous) from 53 male and 27 female subjects. Seventeen of the subjects are healthy kidney donors scanned prior to nephrectomy. The remaining 65 patients were selected by a radiologist from patients who neither had major abdominal pathologies nor pancreatic cancer lesions. Subjects' ages range from 18 to 76 years with a mean age of 46.8 ± 16.7. The CT scans have resolutions of 512x512 pixels with varying pixel sizes and slice thickness between 1.5 − 2.5 mm, acquired on Philips and Siemens MDCT scanners (120 kVp tube voltage).A medical student manually performed slice-by-slice segmentations of the pancreas as ground-truth and these were verified/modified by an experienced radiologist.",
